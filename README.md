# This is one half of a two-part web app.

It's the front-end user interface for a simple website for a set of professional video reels.

The other half is hosted at [test-store-76](https://github.com/quantumtom/test-store-76).

This project was generated using [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

And it employs the [React-Bootstrap](https://github.com/react-bootstrap/react-bootstrap) library to render much of its look and feel.
